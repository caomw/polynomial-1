This code is an implementation of the DD-Poly and ADMM-Poly algorithms described in the CVPR 2013 paper entitled "Continuous Inference in Graphical Models with Polynomial Energies". In particular, the example provided here corresponds to the non-rigid 3D reconstruction example described in Section 4.2 of the paper. Data corresponding to 100 random deformations of a 3x3 square mesh is also provided with the code. The more general purpose of this code is to minimize a polynomial energy that decomposes into local energies that only depend on a small number of overlapping variables. Variables in the code generally follow the notation in the paper.

INSTALLATION:

1) Download the homotopy continuation software HOM4PS-2.0 from http://www.math.nsysu.edu.tw/~leetsung/works/HOM4PS_soft.htm

2) Replace the file hom4ps2 in the downloaded distribution with the one provided with this code.

3) Replace the folder names on lines 27 and 56 of main.m with the appropriate paths.

4) Execute main.m from Matlab.
